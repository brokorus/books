# Books from Tyler's reading list

## README FIRST
  This is a list of some of my favorite books that have helped me grow as a person. I strongly suggest starting with Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking. It sets a good framework for understanding and organizing the lessons from all the books mentioned below.

### Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking
  This book was groundbreaking for me. If you have ever learned philosophy or have studies some neuroscience while also having some interest in computers wow this book is amazing. Daniel Dennet uses philosophy, nueroscience, and computer science to improve the software of your brain, and teaches you both how to use these tricks on other information while giving you literal software to install into your brain. 10/10 my favorite book. I read it once every year or two

### Pitch Anything
  A great exploration of the science behind bussiness interactions. Even applies to social exchanges. A good read for anyone that wants to better understand how they are being manipulated or wants to step up their feeling of status.

### Life 3.0 
  Learn more about what makes humans humans. Then explore how we can improve ourselves and eachother.

### Measure What Matters
  A bit of a wordy walk through on how to leverage the practices that brought Google to where it is today. It works in your personal life as well.

### Running on Empty
  If you had a narcistic parent, this is for you. Read this to learn about yourself in ways you probably didn't know you should have. If you don't know what a narcissist is, this will help understand what they are and the damage they do.

### Team Human
  Ever been called a communist but still like buying things? Yeah, you're probably not a communist, you just give a damn about other people. This is a feel good book for how we humans can better work together.

### Gaslighting
  Everyone should read this, it will prevent you from being manipulated by people. Have you ever felt like you're not good enough? Yeah, you are good enough, you're almost certainly just the victim of gaslighting. Read this to gain confidence and recognize when people are manipulating you to gain for themselves or to make themselves feel better. Note, this usually isn't intentional, but there is no reason you should suffer the damages of this nonsense.

### Blue Ocean strategy explained
  This is for anyone looking to start a new bussiness or product within a business. I'd suggest this for anyone wanting to go into management.

### Weapons of Math Destruction
  Do you not like facebook because it's invasive? This teaches you why you should actually be angry at tech giants. Reach out to me to talk about an alternative world where everyone can gain from the knowledge derived from your data.

### Pig Wrestling
  Just read it, it's short, fun, and simple. If you don't use it yourself, you will immediately identify people in your life who need this process.

### A Man's Search for Meaning
  Ever consider therapy but think Freudian psychology is literally a cocaine driven idea that built an institution that gaslights people into problems they don't actually have? Well I feel that way, turns out, the psychologsts  world has felt the same. There is a relatively new school of Psychology known as Logotherapy. It applies to most people and creates better results for most people. This is an excellent book, please read it if you seek joy and happiness and a better understanding of the human experience.

### Sapiens
  I like to understand humans, so I picked up this book. My favorite aspect that the book speaks of is that of myths. Humans have relied on and still do rely on myths to organize ourselves. Whether it be religion or the stock market, these seemingly intangible things bring us together. I love this exploration and the idea that we can make new myths to better ourselves intentionally.

### The Disney Way
  I went to Disney World with my wife, I don't like theme parks, but the experience was something that amazed me regardless. I saw a very impressively run organization with surgical customer experience excellence and an absurdly happy staff. Turns out, this is literally just a cult, they don't call it a cult in this book. But everything about building a cult is in here and they call it a business model. Well, I don't see why these practices can't be used for good. It's an ok read, I'd say the biggest takeaway that isn't a how to on making a cult is creating stories for everything you are working on. This is well known in software development, but disney applies to a much broader scale across all aspects of their business, and the utility of that shows. Particularly in getting people indoctrinated into the cult of Disney.

### Origin Story
  Interested in where we come from but don't have the whole picture. Read this and Sapiens.

### Homo Deus
  Excellent expansion on sapiens talking about current and future humans. It's a bit wordy, but worth a read.

### Scale
  Ever feel like you can't teach other people to do what you do the right way? Well, this helps you understand how to do that the right way, and grow it so that they can do the same.

### These Truths
  Remember that line, we hold these truths to be self evident? Well they often speak of American history around this time and up to modern times. Well, it isn't truthful how American History is taught. Use this as a stepping stone to get a better idea of the actual brutal and real history of our country.

### The pheonix project
  Interested in working in technology space? Read this to get an idea of some of the struggles that are faced in the industry today. This is a great book to understand the value of DEVOPS

### The unicorn project
  This book is similar to the Pheonix project and is meant as a sequel of sorts. It tells the same story but from the perspective of a Principal software developer. A good read and valuable for some excellent thinking tools.

### Devops Handbook
  After reading the two above books, you probably want a framework that is more tangible, this provides that. Don't treat this like a novel, give it a quick scan, then use it as a reference in future professional situations

### Getting things done
  This is a generic organization of tasks practice, I know many people it has been effective for. I suggest reading it, you don't have to implement the entire system to get a few tips and tricks out of it.

### Trauma Stewardship
  This is a textbook for Nurses to help them navigate the emotional roller coaster that they experience being surrounded by so many hurt and sick people all the time. Turns out, this is the absolute best book ever written on preventing burnout and emotionally accepting the work you do. Use this to protect yourself. I feel like this should be a grade school course that everyone has to learn.

### A New Earth
  This book explores egotism, what it is, how it is toxic, and how some humans have taken it upon themselves to evolve out of it. A great read, definently suggest.
